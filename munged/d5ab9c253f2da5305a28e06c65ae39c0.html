      <p>The <b>Alexander Technique</b> is an approach for the self-prevention of unhelpful or harmful habits that interfere with the mental and physical conditions best suited for the health and functioning of the individual as a whole. Learning to inhibit one's "too quick and unthinking reactions" and to maintain openness and balance as we go about our daily activities can have wide-ranging benefits. The various teaching methods used to teach the Technique (which include hands-on guidance by the teacher) are also referred to as the Alexander Technique.</p> 
      <p>The Alexander Technique is usually learned from individual lessons with a teacher using specialized hand contact and verbal instructions. The Technique is also taught in groups, often using short individual lessons which in turn act as examples to the rest of the class.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="004a68c003f3f76de348e6ec0465476e.html" title="">[1]</a></sup> The Technique takes its name from <a href="d750442eb19e722e246ee0b8abbdc2d2.html" title="F.

      <p>Frederick Matthias Alexander was a Shakespearean <a href="210480565f2b54b0b61b50c93e90e586.html" title="Orator">orator</a> who developed problems with losing his voice. After doctors informed him there was no physical cause, he carefully observed himself in multiple mirrors. This revealed that he was needlessly stiffening his whole body in preparation to recite or speak. Further, Alexander observed that many individuals experiencing voice problems tightened the musculature of the upper torso, especially the neck, prior to <a href="5e400054eaf23d42b6ce5d00384573a8.html" title="Phonation">phonation</a> in anticipation of the act of <a href="a1675570131687743b5157d9452ed57a.html" title="Voicing">voicing</a>; he suggested that this pattern of tensing would rotate the head backwards and downwards in relationship to the spine and disrupt efficient overall body alignment. Over the next eight years, he attempted to change this habit, after which point, he found that the pattern of voice loss had ceased.</p> 
      <p>Alexander believed the <a href="df2a1d4561f6baf509ecda5da1b17d2d.html" title="Empiricism">empirical</a> scientific method, self-observation and <a href="c43382926e490789a45731e43c5a7eea.html" title="Reasoning">reasoning</a> could be used to ease the physical performance of any movement: sitting, standing, walking, using the hands and speaking. He recorded his methods so as to make experimentation and training repeatable. He also trained educators of his <i>technique</i> mainly while living in <a href="3362fb080d9052bb1995483a394e775e.html" title="London">London</a>, UK from 1931 until his death in 1955, except for the wartime period between 1941 to 1943 which was spent teaching with his brother Albert Redden Alexander (1874–1947) in <a href="c2a85106e506d1c935c6af1258c7b0f3.html" title="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, USA.</p>

      <p>The Alexander Technique is learned in order to overcome unwanted physical habits by studying the <a href="bdebebc7cc663a81a4169121586ec3d9.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Kinesthetics">kinesthetic</a> evidence of how thinking is expressed in movement. The values of efficiency and effortlessness are the preferred criteria used to evaluate the often unfamiliar results of progress gained through guided experimentation. Among the methods taught are established forms of structural <a href="b76d2d478e88c0b7ab5f666598e23bc1.html" title="Anatomy">anatomy</a>, characteristics of <a href="713a1f91b1f77942a3e5641228c2649d.html" title="Proprioception">proprioception</a>, how habits may be stopped, refined and well-formed, practical self-observation and the strategic use of empirical reasoning. This study may also demand re-evaluation of self-limiting assumptions, previous choices and conclusions that the Alexander Technique teachers believe keep in place a student's general <i>misuse</i>. The Alexander Technique is considered to be an educational technique taught to be practiced by the student on their own, rather than a curative treatment regimen of the client/patient relationship. It is designed to be used while doing any other activity, so there are no prescriptive forms of movements to follow.</p> 
      <p>Each of these methods is reflected in special terms of F.M. Alexander's. These ideas are taught as seamless discoveries of easier movement in the context of goal-setting objectives; usually and can easily be lost to sensory ability or memory. An experience of kinesthetic unfamiliarity dangerously encourages the re-selection of the old habit over possible improvements, defeating the objective of experimentation. As such, is cautioned against by Alexander teachers and this cautioning is expressed in another term: "End-gaining." If modification is desired, experimentation is recommended by Alexander rather than gaining one's end by familiar means, choosing the new criteria of efficiency or effortlessness over familiarity.</p> 
      <p>How habits may be stopped, refined or well-formed is reflected in Alexander's specialized use of the word "Inhibition" and "Direction." Although in the works of <a href="c775f834239bda2e41d5c7ec29acf899.html" title="Sigmund Freud">Sigmund Freud</a> the term <a href="195fa2419f6666b16b9fcf1ae4c26650.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Inhibition">inhibition</a> refers to a holding of the <a href="90eafece5c9e8a5704d831c5618f8add.html" title="Libido">libido</a> in check; in the Alexander Technique, the same word has quite a different meaning: "inhibition" is a moment of conscious awareness that interrupts a habitual pattern of muscular misuse and stablishes instead a new use of the self based on the means-whereby a Head-Neck-Back relationships is stablished known as the HBN Pattern.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="0d13c677e449b4d8f29d5aff14f08537.html" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

      <p>Applications are subjective by nature; many testimonies exist on the Internet. Alexander Technique is regarded to be a helpful adjunct to traditional medical treatment regimens and not as a substitute.</p> 
      <p>Some regard the Alexander Technique as a first-hand experience of the reality of body/mind unity. Proponents believe that its practice results in improved awareness and descriptive ability, as well as improved ease of movement, improved balance, stamina and less muscular tension. Additionally, those who practice it often report that Alexander Technique gives them an enhanced ability to clarify their thinking, gain objectivity about themselves and free themselves from unintentional self-imposed limitations. Further, proponents see Alexander Technique as a way to use less effort for movement and thus perform more efficiently, feeling younger and moving gracefully.</p>

      <p>Although the Alexander Technique is considered by those in its field to be primarily educational—taught in a student/teacher relationship as compared to being a treatment regimen between client and practitioner—it is regarded by the <a href="6bb699ea53f6f3343ebe4a9a2748a7c4.html" title="National Health Service">United Kingdom National Health Service</a> to offer an alternative and complementary management for many medical complaints.

      <p>Alexander Technique has also been known to help performers with getting past the <i>plateau</i> effect (despite trying, no improvement), performance anxiety, getting beyond a supposed "lack of talent" and to sharpen discrimination and descriptive ability. It has also helped people control unwanted reactions, phobias and depression.</p> 
      <p><i>Reported Effects:</i> Evidence of change is sought in verifiable outside feedback; using a mirror; by noting, comparing, or describing differences of the relative location of one's eyes, balance or weight changes; a change in the sound of one's voice or the effects on one’s objectives, props or environment.</p> 
      <p>Students often describe the immediate effect of an <i>Alexander lesson</i> as being an unfamiliar feeling of lightness or expansion. During hands-on lessons, most pupils report an immediate result of feeling less weighted down, despite their inability to evoke or sustain this state by themselves. Other reported experiences include altered perception of their voice or environment, noticing a change in self image, or having temporary disorientations of where their body is located spatially.</p>

      <p>The English novelist <a href="04b03386dcf3dd6943ace19fdab5345a.html" title="Aldous Huxley">Aldous Huxley</a> was strongly influenced by F. M.

      <p>Alexander Technique may not be effective for everyone. Most teachers consider twenty to forty lessons to be required. Learning requires the student to work at a somewhat paradoxical goal that is, at first, based on the teacher's (or classmates') perception of success. In rare occasions, undoing old habits may trigger possibly unpleasant "unresolved" emotions that originally were the basis for the development of the subject's habitual remedies. Through release of these habitual remedies, an adjustment of other facets of the person may be necessary - sometimes involving medical practictioners.</p> 
      <p>Practising Alexander Technique cannot affect structural deformities (such as <a href="0057d615c0d2dbb77f9d1212d1be4d28.html" title="Arthritis">arthritis</a> or other bone problems), or other diseases, (such as <a href="fed509cc4cd3891239cbb1ee73e72f73.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Parkinson's">Parkinson's</a>, etc.) In these cases, Alexander Technique can only mitigate how the person compensates for these difficulties, which can be significant for them.</p>

      <p>The effectiveness of the Alexander Technique has not been thoroughly verified in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Lengthy learning time seems to be a drawback in testing for short term results. In 1999, Dennis ran a controlled study of the effect of AT on the "Functional Reach" (associated with balance) of women older than 65 arguing for a significant improvement in performance.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="65bcc33271968152ddb327879b62cff3.html" title="">[9]</a></sup>. In 2005 Cacciatore et al. found the technique improved a single patient's posture thereby reducing their lower back pain.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="2ceb0693b7ab03923dc7e4aac85939cb.html" title="">[10]</a></sup> Further, in 2004 Maher concluded that "Physical treatments, such as ... Alexander technique ... are either of unknown value or ineffective and so should not be considered" when treating lower back pain with an evidence-based approach.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="8bd5be4be35da7532858384127e8b1b0.html" title="">[11]</a></sup> Finally, in 2002, Stalibrass et al. published the results of a significant controlled study into the effectiveness of the technique in treating Parkinson's disease. Four different measures were used to assess the change in severity of the disease. By all four measures, Alexander Technique was better than no treatment, to a statistically significant degree (both P-values &lt; 0.04). However, when compared to a control group given massage sessions, Alexander technique was only significantly better by two of the measures. The other two measures gave statisticially insignificant improvements (P-values of approximately 0.1 and 0.6). This appears to lend some weight to the effectiveness of the Technique, but more studies and data are required.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="cc6143cef83c7168d0ef49cbd89111ce.html" title="">[12]</a></sup></p> 
      <p>Finally, while there is an abundance of anecdotal evidence which suggests that AT instruction contributes to improved vocal quality and vocal health (including its apparent success in treating the vocal health issues of its creator, Alexander), only two studies of AT use with voice were found<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="79ec7425671a47d6011afacc1fe8ac8d.html" title="">[13]</a></sup>,<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="2199dd4d2a1dfed7735109ad4bae4894.html" title="">[14]</a></sup>, neither of which were published in peer-reviewed journals. In both, there was an apparent attempt to measure the effects of AT on voice and to analyze some data; however, neither methodology nor statistics were provided to lend scientific credence to the interpreted results (e.g., representative sampling, control groups or blind testing) or acoustic measurements (i.e., microphone type, microphone placement, microphone directionality, recording environment, recording media – all of which could affect the spectral characteristics of the recording). Thus, while both studies may report actual effects, one cannot have confidence that they demonstrate anything more than possibly placebo improvements without the inclusion of carefully designed methodologies, legitimate metrics or statistical analysis.</p>
