      <p>The system was a consolidation of several smaller streetcar lines assembled in the late 1890s and early 1900s by <a href="4d77efbe1a5710151ee140742c37ce4b.html" title="Francis Marion Smith">Francis Marion "Borax" Smith</a>, an entrepreneur who made a fortune in his namesake mineral, and then turned to real estate and electric traction. The Key System began as the "<b>San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose Railway (SFOSJR)</b>", incorporated in 1902. Service began on <a href="32687ab276668ddad70c4cc0de203c53.html" title="October 26">October 26</a>, <a href="ef8e717b1dff397b979317bf0a455b2a.html" title="1903">1903</a> with a 4-car train carrying 250 passengers, departing <a href="8612bf99aca43af035f8615363e0c27f.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Downtown Berkeley, California">downtown Berkeley</a> for the <a href="a9d2158161b5cc264bd334e2a4eb0fd0.html" title="Ferry">ferry</a> pier. Before the end of that same year, the general manager of the SFOSJR came up with the idea of using a stylized map on which the system's routes were laid out on the pattern of an old-fashioned key, with three "handle loops" that covered the East Bay cities of Berkeley, Piedmont (initially, "Claremont" shared the Piedmont loop) and Oakland, and a "shaft" in the form of the Key pier, the "teeth" representing the ferry berths at the end of the pier. The company touted its "<b>key route</b>", which eventually led to the company adopting the name "Key System".</p> 
      <p>In 1908, the SFOSJR changed its name to the San Francisco, Oakland &amp; San Jose Consolidated Railway. This was again changed to the San Francisco-Oakland Terminal Railway in 1912. This incarnation of the Key system went bankrupt in December of 1923, and was re-organized as the <b>Key System Transit Co.</b>, transforming what had begun as a marketing buzzword into the name of the company.</p> 
      <p>Following the Great <a href="1a6672cd6099434b62de240ca09cfb4d.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Crash of 1929">Crash of 1929</a>, the name was changed yet again as part of another re-organization. A holding company called the Railway Equipment &amp; Realty Co. was created, with the subsidiary Key System Ltd. running the commuter trains. In 1938, the name became simply the Key System.</p> 
      <p>During <a href="888ac4a56a4523ff7d70c095a3dfddeb.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, the Key System built and operated the <a href="1765440d1af9ec31669a21dc4ae971a8.html" title="Shipyard Railway">Shipyard Railway</a>, a special line running between a transfer station in Emeryville and the <a href="de23d3c9bf27e6d64b55ed7c051f87e9.html" title="Kaiser Shipyards">Kaiser Shipyards</a> in Richmond.</p>

      <p>The initial connection across the Bay to San Francisco was by ferryboat via a causeway and pier ("<a href="33f5323f8e7cbeb552b5294e8f720995.html" title="Mole (architecture)">mole</a>"), extending from the end of Yerba Buena Avenue in <a href="6111736753127f6c0ec11028e4c7d2bb.html" title="Oakland, California">Oakland, California</a> westward 16,000 feet (4,900 meters) across the Bay to a ferry terminal near <a href="1903953583cd2f7d464d0e70c3aec6f8.html" title="Yerba Buena Island">Yerba Buena Island</a>. Filling for the nascent causeway had actually been started by a short-lived narrow gauge railroad company in the late 1800s, the <a href="cb4bf70520b030060ab33c8e906a7403.html" title="California and Nevada Railroad">California and Nevada Railroad</a>. "Borax" Smith acquired the causeway from the California and Nevada upon its bankruptcy. The Key System operated a fleet of ferries between the Key Route Pier <sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="29d437f287fc917ac0d77ae73184d8a3.html" title="">[2]</a></sup> and the San Francisco Ferry Building until <a href="fcfebadf343f28f04acac84eb847b987.html" title="1939">1939</a> when a new dual track opened on the lower deck of the <a href="e9408dc49dbdae66eec8575b59eb1a48.html" class="mw-redirect" title="San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge">San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge</a> bringing Key System trains to the then-new <a href="5766c687bf2f2d08cfa0da51dbc827a8.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Transbay Terminal">Transbay Terminal</a> in San Francisco's downtown. The bridge railway and Transbay Terminal were shared with the <a href="8f2bf272b386a8f72086926b7c36ad00.html" title="Southern Pacific Railroad">Southern Pacific</a>'s <a href="38eee5ea00bc8f156bc97fbc5efc60e0.html" title="East Bay Electric Lines">Interurban Electric</a> and the <a href="9e26b7fa6217483096880b6dcb9a856c.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Sacramento Northern">Sacramento Northern</a> railroads.</p> 
      <p>The Key System's first trains were composed of standard wooden railroad <a href="5ffc8bb0e52f339493a49f0f460f9b36.html" title="Passenger car (rail)">passenger cars</a>, complete with <a href="e00a2b5cd9fb163ebd57e1b69c90402d.html" title="Clerestory">clerestory</a> roofs. Atop each of these, a pair of <a href="45e407dc54a87a64bee82ca20ab57e52.html" title="Pantograph (rail)">pantographs</a>, designed and constructed by the Key System's own shops, were installed to collect current from overhead wires to power a pair of electric motors on each car, one on each truck (bogie).</p> 
      <p>The design of the Key's rolling stock changed over the years. Wood gave way to steel, and, instead of doors at each end, center doors were adopted.</p> 
      <p>The later rolling stock consisted of specially-designed "bridge units" for use on the new San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, articulated cars sharing a common central truck and including central passenger entries in each car, a forerunner of the design of most light rail vehicles today. Several of these pairs were connected to make up a train. Power pickup was via <a href="be2c98b157012ce7b2760e9d34f27ffb.html" title="Pantograph (rail)">pantograph</a> from overhead catenary wires, except on the Bay Bridge where a third rail pickup was used. The Key's trains ran on 600 volt direct current, compared to the 1200 volts used by the SP commuter trains. The cars had an enclosed operator's cab in the right front, with passenger seats extending to the very front of the vehicle, a favorite seat for many children, with dramatic views of the tracks ahead.</p> 
      <p>The exterior color of the cars was orange and cream white with a pale green stripe at the window level. Interior upholstery was woven reed seat covers in one of the articulated sections, and leather in the other, the smoking section. The flooring was <a href="d31bf7ba23356bbc853ca8299ba77d26.html" title="Linoleum">linoleum</a>. During World War II, the roofs were painted gray for aerial camouflage. After acquisition by National City Lines, all Key vehicles including the bridge units were re-painted in that company's standard colors, yellow and green.</p>

      <p>Until the Bay Bridge railway began operation, the Key commuter trains had no letter designation. They were named for the principal street or district they served.</p> 
      <ul>

       <li>B - Trestle Glen (originally ran through a Key hotel, the Key Route Inn at Grand and Broadway in Oakland; the Inn burned down in the 1930s)</li> 
       <li>C - Piedmont</li> 
       <li>E - Claremont (ran directly to the <a href="67daf3b874723ee993493f60d4e008c9.html" title="Claremont Resort">Claremont Hotel</a>, terminating on a track between the two tennis courts; today the tennis courts remain in place)</li> 
       <li>F - Berkeley / Adeline Street (was also extended on former Southern Pacific interurban tracks on Shattuck beyond University Avenue and through the SP's Northbrae Tunnel, terminating at <a href="a9d60775821af0b807d46a27921b493d.html" title="Solano Avenue">Solano Avenue</a> and The Alameda</li>

       <li>H - Monterey Avenue (originally, the Sacramento Street Line; the original line ran up Hopkins, but was switched to the SP's old tracks up Monterey after 1941)</li> 
       <li>K - College Avenue (also a streetcar shuttle providing a connection at Shattuck Avenue with the F transbay train); this line ran extra cars and was heavily used on football game days as its terminus was only a few blocks away from UC's Memorial Stadium</li> 
       <li>D was reserved for a proposed line into <a href="13e902ae14f87d799dac69e48d0dd1e6.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Montclair, Oakland">Montclair</a> alongside the <a href="a4da1b396767dac8e211292b2be40717.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Sacramento Northern">Sacramento Northern</a> interurban railway</li> 
      </ul> 
      <p>The A, B, C, E and F lines were the last rail lines operating in the system's final years.

These same letter designations were preserved by A.C. Transit when it took over the Key System, and are still in use; AC Transit's B, C, E and F lines follow more or less the same routes today that the correspondingly designated Key routes took.</p>

The Key streetcars were painted green and cream white until they were re-painted in the green and yellow scheme of National City Lines after NCL acquired the Key System. The last Key streetcars ran in 1948.</p>

      <p>From the beginning, the Key System had been conceived as a dual real estate and transportation system. "Borax" Smith and his partner <a href="71d32997b15e72e7bee22619715a0a62.html" title="Frank C. Havens">Frank C. Havens</a> first established a company called the "Realty Syndicate" which acquired large tracts of undeveloped land throughout the East Bay. The Realty Syndicate also built two large hotels, each served by a San Francisco-bound train, the <a href="29a93cfb4ae124593a24b1cd9dcf55c6.html" title="Claremont Resort">Claremont</a> and the <a href="13dffe6c9dcb1d35ef40975d453f4a95.html" title="Key Route Inn">Key Route Inn</a>, and a popular amusement park in Oakland called <a href="4bac0d299f58d3db5f35cc91553ce0f5.html" title="Idora Park">Idora Park</a>. Streetcar lines were also routed to serve all these properties, thereby enhancing their value. In its early years, the Key System was actually a subsidiary of the Realty Syndicate.</p>
