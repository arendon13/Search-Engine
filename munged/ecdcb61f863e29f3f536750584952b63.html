      <p>Unlike all the other halls of residence apart from Farrer, Howitt is organised in a floor-based design, consisting of 12 floors each housing approximately 20 residents. Each floor is furnished with bathrooms and a communal kitchen for preparing meals. This doubles as a social meeting place at meal-times. All the other halls (bar <a href="82e3237cbba3be17df71b91d87ba4444.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Farrer Hall">Farrer</a>) differ in that they have one very large kitchen to service the entire hall.</p>

      <p>Farrer Hall is the most adventurous hall at Monash. Since the start of 2008 Farrer Hall has not slept, and most residents are on a first name basis with the security guards.</p> 
      <p>Farrer is divided into two buildings, Commons and Lords, with an annex to Commons called Chastity which is located above the common room. The Hall has more focus on floors, with kitchens, laundries and common rooms shared across them. Commons (the largest) consists of three separate floors and have a diverse mix of students. Lords is notably the quieter part of Farrer with much more emphasis placed on studying and being in bed at a reasonable hour than the other floors. Chastity is a notoriously social floor due to both a smaller number of students, and being positioned above the main entrances into Farrer Hall.</p> 
      <p>The computer lab as well as music room is found in the ground floor of Lords - where there are no residential rooms. Farrer Hall has a pool room that is a closed of attachment to the common room, as such Farrer boasts the best Pool players out of all Monash Residential. The winner of the 2008 pool tournament is a current resident of Farrer Hall. There is also a library in Farrer, which used to contain a single book. The book is currently missing. Farrer participates in many inter-hall sports but ultimately shines in Australian Rules football.</p> 
      <p>Farrer Places great emphasis on all residents bonding as a Hall. In order to do this it requires the finest Resident Advisors, an extremely active Hall Society; Farrer Hall Society (or FHS for short) and dedicated Floor Representatives.</p>

      <p>Richardson Hall is the newest of the Halls of Residence at <a href="8bf055b5fc714d6566dc09567be9cc8a.html" title="Monash University">Monash University</a>. Richardson is home to 190 residents from a variety of backgrounds. Richardson is commonly known as the 'International hall' to residents of other halls, due to the high incidence of international students residing in Richardson, a tradition that the hall has been continuing since the mid 1970s.</p> 
      <p>Richardson Hall, along with its neighbour <a href="7ce29f027424f89536d39fdcc247e467.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Roberts Hall">Roberts Hall</a> are built around the "Stairway" concept. There are 9 residential and 1 common stairways, with each being broken into between 4 and 7 levels. Each level has between 2 and 6 residents. Usually, 5 residents share a common bathroom and <a href="3d49bf10c838df0fdf9740ffb6e3f0cd.html" title="Kitchenette">kitchenette</a> area with 10 people to a large common fridge.This arrangement offers privacy and relaxed social contact amongst relatively small groups in addition to the communal common areas. Newspapers are delivered directly to the Hall every morning, so residents can sit quietly and read the paper whilst having a coffee or waiting for their washing to finish. <a href="a08fc7f36d2e4aa2fabd516656923789.html" title="Resident assistant">RA</a>'s run a small shop almost every evening, where soft drinks, snacks and other essentials can be purchased. In Richardson Hall, the stairways are numbered 2 - 9. Stairway 1 is the Common Areas containing the newly-completed Exercise Room, Computer Lab, Moose Room, TV Rooms,Projector room with cable TV, Common Room, Kitchen and Laundry.</p> 
      <p>The Hall has an outlook over a lake and the University grounds with a large variety of bird life, and is close to the facilities and faculties of the University, in particular the gymnasium and swimming pools.</p> 
      <p>The Residential Support Team, made up of the RA's, Senior RA, Deputy College Head and College Head, is the primary support and management body within the Hall.</p> 
      <p>There is an opportunity for students who remain in the Hall and become senior residents, to take on leadership roles through; becoming Resident Advisors (RAs); being on the Halls Society Committee; or being elected to the Orientation Committee.</p> 
      <p>Richardson Hall has a total of 188 rooms.</p>

      <p>The South East Flats is located at the south-eastern corner of the university's Clayton campus. It is made up of two <a href="0cb2084e2174fa8f95c6b12e9b76caee.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Block of flats">blocks of flats</a>, and the flat sizes range from 2 bedrooms to 5 bedrooms. There are 30 <a href="09e0cf3035f12332b4f42ea1ad84b4f9.html" title="Apartment">flats</a> in total, designed to accommodate 130 students. Each flat is fully furnished to include all the necessities of student life, such as chairs and a table.</p> 
      <p>The main difference between the halls of residence and the South East Flats is the support services given to the students. There is a very low level of interaction between the residents and the resident advisors; this example is set by the College Head. Thus, the resident advisors and College Head choose to keep a low profile and play a minimal and purely administrative role in the day-to-day existence of the South East Flats, as opposed to the more personal and convivial atmosphere offered at the halls of residence. Several functions are held throughout the year for the residents, however, these typically have a very low rate of attendance. 2006 saw the addition of a common recreational area, known as the pavilion; this is available exclusively to residents of the South East Flats.</p> 
      <p>Within the Monash Residential community, the South East Flats is renowned for its quiet and calm atmosphere, which is not only conducive to study, but also allows the residents to indulge in the most popular social activity at the flats, <a href="05d23bc13059fa033a5e5022379bcf55.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Bird watching">bird watching</a>.</p>
