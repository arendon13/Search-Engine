      <p>Elfwood was originally founded on <a href="f974af59a199205732829db7d398d599.html" title="May 1">May 1</a>, <a href="8b6098057f12af7daecc637f9366cf69.html" title="1996">1996</a>, by Thomas Abrahamsson, under the name of the "Lothlorien" project and was aimed at amateur high-fantasy artists. At the time, its gallery consisted of three artists (including Abrahamsson), and all submissions and updates to the site were managed directly by Abrahamsson, with the individual users e-mailing Abrahamsson with their requested submissions or changes. As the Lothlorien membership and gallery expanded, Abrahamsson developed a feature (called "Extranet") allowing Elfwood members to manage their own individual art galleries and account information directly, without requiring webmaster assistance.</p> 
      <p>After a while, "Zone 47" was created for sci-fi and modern fantasy art, and two years later the "Wyvern's Library" was created for written science fiction and fantasy submissions.</p> 
      <p>A few months later, <b>FARP</b> (<b>F</b>antasy <b>A</b>rt <b>R</b>esource <b>P</b>roject) was created. In April 2000 the <b>ERB</b> (<b>E</b>lfwood <b>R</b>eview <b>B</b>oard) was founded; it is responsible for maintaining the rules on Elfwood. In June 2001, Elfwood was closed due to death threats and reopened a month later. In August the FanQuarter area was opened.</p> 
      <p>At the end of 2001 changes to Elfwood were closed so a more manageable system could be created. Elfwood was reopened in February 2002 with a new moderating system. After that, every update has had to go through the Elfwood moderators. Along with the new moderating system came Mod's Choice awards. These awards are designated by a star on the thumbnail and an icon of a phoenix feather on the page of the artwork. Each day's Mod's Choice awards can be found on the Elfwood homepage.</p> 
      <p>In January 2004 the sections known as Zone 47 and Lothlorien followed suit with the Wyvern's Library, merging to create the current SF&amp;F Art area. Along with the change came a new layout for the whole site, as well as revisions to the rules.</p> 
      <p>Elfwood had a major crash on the first of April in 2005. All data was lost and the last backup was from February. The site came back with a timewarp to February and the rules were again revised and rewritten.</p> 
      <p>Elfwood celebrated its 10th anniversary in May of 2006, and to commemorate this anniversary, the Opus Fantasy Arts Festival held the very first Elfwood summit in conjunction with the festival. A guest writer and guest artist was featured at the summit.</p> 
      <p>In September 2007, Elfwood was transformed into a commercial community, adding new features for creating user profiles also for visiting users, tagging of favorite members and works and much more.</p>

      <p>Elfwood currently host a sub section dedicated to articles on the creation of Fantasy and Science Fiction art and stories called the "FARP", which stands for the "Fantasy Art Resource Project". It is a free guide to the techniques used by artists and writers of Elfwood in the creation of their work. The name is slightly misleading since the section also contain articles on writing and world creation in general. It also features the history of art, tricks &amp; tips, and so much more.</p>

The community mainly consists of Elfwood users and random Internet folks, creating an interesting, artistic and unique place in the Internet. Elftown has features such as diaries, a messaging system, a wiki, forums, guestbooks and polls about anything and everything. Being of a mainly artistic origin, the users of Elftown (commonly referred to as "Elftowners") share a wide spread variety of art and styles, including everything from traditional to modern, and much beyond this. With time, Elftown has become more than only a place to share art, but is now known to be host of whatever its users want to share - thoughts, opinions, interests and whatever else there is to chatter about. Elftown is located in <a href="ebab2574c0c20dabb6c6a54983575db4.html" title="Lysator">Lysator</a>'s computer hall and runs on small modern hardware bought by donations from its users.</p>

      <p>Elfwood came under fire in 2004 when one of its underage artists, Margaret "Katy" Wilkerson, went missing. She was found with a man who allegedly found her through the site <a href="e38922c31b0bec04137b3d23181c9cfd.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amw.com/missing_children/brief.cfm?id=28847" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="ce9ec86b2710d59ca4e9d1df900b7a60.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.elfwood.com/art/k/a/katynaya/katynaya.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.</p> 
      <p>Elfwood has rules about the theme and quality of the submitted material, which can seem strict to some people; a piece cannot usually, for example, be on lined paper, poorly cropped or in the case of writing, have faulty HTML.</p> 
      <p>Each piece is reviewed by moderators before being displayed in a gallery, and profanity and provocative language is not allowed <a href="9ede4a6bc83134f3cfa3df048015653e.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.elfwood.com/erb/rules1.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. Some Elfwood fans consider the rules necessary to ensure a certain level of quality in the art they find there. Others criticize these rules for restricting artistic freedom. As of <a href="5861fef763f9742a0c6532c038d7e859.html" title="August 31">August 31</a>, <a href="2ea254a0be715ad814eb56ac9553de2e.html" title="2005">2005</a> the rules have been even further defined and simplified.</p>
