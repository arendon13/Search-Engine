      <p><i><b>Jimbo and the Jet Set</b></i> (often shortened to simply <i><b>Jimbo</b></i>) was a <a href="67119c5f4af66a5ffe40efd75c40f791.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Uk">British</a> <a href="d23a7593af8b526d7c7b031d90daf173.html" title="Animation">animated</a> cartoon series in the <a href="b236623a11084e1a60700ece86dca902.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>, featuring the adventures of the eponymous Jimbo, a talking <a href="4ed9ef1e4273c51967fab233a86a75d9.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Aeroplane">aeroplane</a>. Created by Maddocks Cartoon Productions, it originally ran for 25 episodes between <a href="c5688ebbd1d68edca87f49f3dc12892e.html" title="1985">1985</a> and <a href="79ec7425671a47d6011afacc1fe8ac8d.html" title="1986">1986</a>.</p> 
      <p>The proviso to the cartoon is that Jimbo was originally intended to be a <a href="5b27fb1bf7a06ddf48ae9dc9c8510040.html" title="Boeing 747">Jumbo Jet</a>, but his designer couldn't tell the difference between <a href="68296bd0b32b3a9944ff3b12635685d3.html" title="Inch">inches</a> and <a href="430374984b1221faeb6961410c48c2b1.html" title="Centimetre">centimetres</a>, resulting in his diminutive size.</p> 
      <p>The television series featured various talking airport-type ground vehicles (Tommy Tow-Truck, Claude Catering, Amanda Baggage, Phil the Fuel Truck, Sammy Steps, etc), and Harry Helicopter. Other plane characters appear from time to time, such as Old Timer, a <a href="9d10cd2ea1d2ea206cbf6161ee538371.html" title="Vickers Wellington">Vickers Wellington</a> bomber who gets into the story while flying to or from an <a href="a3220e8358bb6c31c69386ac1397accb.html" title="Airshow">airshow</a>. The story is based at a fictional "London Airport", under the command of an irate controller who frequently ends episodes screaming "I want words with you, Jimbo!".</p> 
      <p>Some printed material and toy merchandise featured Gloria Gatwick, a female counterpart to Jimbo, but she did not appear in a speaking role within the TV episodes (save for one brief appearance in one episode, where she can be clearly seen from a top-viewed angle).</p>
