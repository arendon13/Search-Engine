      <p>The book series is about a young boy named Charlie Ashanti who can talk the language of cats, after accidentally swapping blood with a leopard cub. Charlie is on the run from a floating circus, with six lions in tow, aiming to return them to the wild of Morocco and to rescue his parents who have been kidnapped by a sinister corporation.</p> 
      <p>The first book is known simply as <b>Lionboy</b>. The sequel, <b>Lionboy: The Chase</b>, continues the story of Charlie and the lions, with most of the story set in Venice. It was published by Puffin in the summer of <a href="3b7a2e713ce59b3e7f14609c719d2dcd.html" title="2004">2004</a>. The final installment of the trilogy, <b>Lionboy: The Truth</b>, concludes the story and was published in January 2006.</p> 
      <p>The trilogy is available in 36 languages.</p>

      <p>The series is set at an unspecified time in the Earth's future. The world in the books mostly resembles the modern day world, with a few key differences. These differences are hinted at rather than explained outright. Firstly, most of the world's oil has been used up, and petrol cars are now only used by the very rich, elite and powerful. <a href="2a2825dbc860f7304730478fa1456978.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Aeroplanes">Aeroplanes</a> are not flown at all - sea travel is once again the dominant form of overseas travel. The world (at least, the parts seen in Charlie's journey) now seems to run efficiently on solar and wind power.</p> 
      <p>The major world <a href="293e95281a4438af490e8d30f381b48a.html" title="Superpower">superpower</a> in the series is known only as the Empire, and the text contains hints that this is actually the <a href="7a6aa97641b76436dca68517f1d81c45.html" title="United States">United States</a>. <a href="b6bc1eaa561afc63f0a1f43089ef9c4b.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> seems to be under this Empire's control. The world has been changed by global warming and other environmental influences; the most notable example is the ruin of <a href="c9346932d3b8ec09a70e0a4494093611.html" title="Venice">Venice</a>, which is now half sunken under rising waters, and otherwise decayed from pollution.</p> 
      <p>The Corporacy, a pharmaceutical megacorporation, is a major economic power that has "Gated Communities" all over the world.</p>

      <p>Charlie is a young boy who is able to speak to cats (and all felines) due to an accident involving a leopard cub's blood when he was a baby. He lives in London with his parents, Dr. Aneba Ashanti and Professor Magdalen Start, both of whom are <a href="0f424c98d66e95d05d42ba5503ac738e.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Scientists">scientists</a> working on a cure for <a href="ea1ab4ceac986e14885a57de0ca52410.html" title="Asthma">asthma</a> and other <a href="a360735df5c149beb2b93cee158a3014.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Allergies">allergies</a>.</p> 
      <p>His parents, as a result of their scientific discoveries, are kidnapped by a <a href="37e3f4b03d761fa9f241b65057deacb3.html" title="Pharmaceutical company">pharmaceutical company</a> known mysteriously as the Corporacy. Charlie, closely avoiding being kidnapped himself, sets out to find them and ends up onboard a <a href="c6bddd5a09c213be5ef6dd431ad7a0e6.html" title="Circus">circus</a> ship making its way to <a href="e03a30c31c2de2fcd8051bb6d74ddd19.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>. On board he befriends most of the circus performers as well as (using his gift) a pride of beautiful performing lions who seek the boy's help to escape their cruel trainer. Meanwhile, the vicious criminal Rafi Sadler, in the employ of the Corporacy, is hot on his heels, going to any lengths to get his hands on Charlie. The circus ship arrives in Paris and Charlie escapes with the lions. They make their way to <a href="31cc687d5a25aed1b72a6eb4a84e5f88.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Gare d'Austerlitz">Gare d'Austerlitz</a> where they hide on a train destined for <a href="d1187c792a1cfbb9d1b8c6bc8c4ee30a.html" title="Venice">Venice</a>, the place Charlie's parents are rumored to have been taken.</p> 
      <p>The book ends with Charlie and the lions being discovered by the train's most regal passenger, the <a href="77e9fefd6a9c0de49cbf2748a11150cb.html" title="Monarch">King</a> of <a href="97ceb2ea33d41ccdb0cbe2e6c18c3efb.html" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, who surprisingly offers to help Charlie with his quest.</p>

Edward however has other plans for the lions than letting them journey onwards.

However this plan is foiled with the help of local cats and a conspiracy of <a href="4e63a2b20439210e518ed981009e8c71.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Gondoliers">gondoliers</a>.</p> 
      <p>Venice is liberated from the Doge's rule, and so Charlie journeys from Venice by boat, taking the lions back to their home in <a href="e0c0cabab7f89bd3fadf8dd9dc75d62e.html" title="Essaouira">Essaouira</a>, <a href="4edcca0e79c895a2c0dd98f3dce948fc.html" title="Morocco">Morocco</a>.

      <p>Charlie, after only a few blissful days reunited with his parents, is captured by the revenge-seeking Maccomo, who puts him on a ship and takes him (along with Rafi) to the Corporacy headquarters on the island of San Antonio near <a href="ebc75c1c09a3565470315302c82767fd.html" title="Haiti">Haiti</a>. His parents are in hot pursuit, and following them is Claudio, King Boris, the Young Lion and Elsina.</p> 
      <p>Charlie, due to his cat blood, is immune to the tainted, brainwashing air of the island, and with the help of a multilingual <a href="4083f31a963f9ae0e37c304b131678bc.html" title="Chameleon">chameleon</a> named Ninu, and the cat Sergei, he single-handedly puts a stop to the Corporacy's deeds and rescues the brainwashed employees and prisoners of the island.</p>

       <li><b>Maccomo</b>, the cruel trainer of the lions, who is jealous of Charlie's ability to talk to felines. Maccomo had been drugging the lions for years, forcing them to do his bidding. Charlie, in saving the lions from the circus, begins using Maccomo's drug against him, and Maccomo soon becomes addicted to its effects, continuing to take it of his own will after Charlie and the lions have escaped. Bent on revenge, he travels to Morocco and awaits their arrival. The lions overpower him and take him prisoner, but he outwits them and escapes, kidnapping Charlie and taking him to the Corporacy's island. There, he is not rewarded for his efforts, but rather brainwashed along with the other inhabitants of the island.</li> 
       <li><b>Pirouette</b>, the circus's star acrobat and <a href="5ce2530f4199d87a511eec9513586201.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Trapeze artist">trapeze artist</a>. Kind to Charlie.</li>
