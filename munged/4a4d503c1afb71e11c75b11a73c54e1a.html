      <p>The Privy Council Registers record that "the late Robert Lawder of The Bass" had loaned two thousand pounds to Queen Mary and Darnley. This had not been repaid, and Sir Robert's curator and executor [and son-in-law] David Preston of Craigmillar was now suing Sir John Stewart of Traquair as one of those who had guaranteed the loan. The argument was that "the said laird of Craigmillar and Elizabeth Hay, Lady Bass, relict and executrix of the said Robert" expected Sir John Stewart to pay up. They won this round. However it returned, on appeal, to the Privy Council on 3rd and 19 October, 1579, and again on <a href="24e570786fc7b0aced15d498c8864650.html" title="September 27">September 27</a>, <a href="28b21231ab4f4a2d70567fd98ba52ff8.html" title="1580">1580</a>.
