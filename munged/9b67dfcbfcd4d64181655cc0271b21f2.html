      <p><b>Yelena</b> - 19, Yelena was raised in an orphanage in the Territory of Ixia's Military District #5. General Brazell, the leader of MD-5, made sure the kids in the orphanage had everything they needed. In between school lessons, Yelena learned acrobatics, hung out with her friends May and Carra, and competed in the annual Fire Festival. When she turned 16, she was invited to help the General and his son, Reyad with some important experiments. The experiments didn't go well at all, and after two years, Yelena ended up in the Commander of Ixia's dungeon awaiting execution for the murder of Reyad. After a year living in a rat-infested, dank cell, she was offered a choice instead. Become the Commander's new Food Taster or go to the gallows.</p> 
      <p><b>Valek</b> - 33, As the chief of security, Valek’s duties involve keeping the Territory of Ixia and the Commander safe. He’s in charge of a vast network of spies throughout Ixia and into the southern lands of Sitia. The work suits him as he enjoys putting together pieces of information and discovering plots and plans well before they’re initiated. Patience learned when he studied the assassin arts aids him when he does find an illegal activity in full swing. Watching and learning as much as he can, Valek will only pounce when he’s assured of catching all the culprits. He’s not only confident, but cocky as well. Working as an assassin has given Valek excellent sword fighting abilities, as well as knife combat, moving without making a sound, and being able to open any lock without a key. His assassin skills also made him a key player when the Commander toppled the corrupt monarchy of Ixia. Assassinating King Ixia and his entire family was a defining moment for Valek. He finally exacted revenge on the King for allowing his royal tax collectors to murder Valek’s three older brothers when he was 13. His keen intelligence and grasp of military tactics makes him a formidable Adviser. His loyalty is without question, and, once he makes a promise, he will follow through or die trying. His weapon of choice is a broadsword, but he enjoys a good knife fight with a skilled opponent and he is well versed in every form of poison. Being immune to magic is another weapon he holds and it has helped him more than once. The art of death has also led Valek to another art, creating life-like sculptures from rocks. He enjoys carving and polishing dull lumps of grey stone into statues of animals, insects, flowers, and other natural items. Valek prefers to work alone, but recently he’s been intrigued by the Commander’s new food taster. He has never met someone so quick to learn yet so exasperating. Her stubborn determination and unwillingness to trust are admirable qualities, but Valek has yet to figure her out. She’s a puzzle, but he’s confident that with patience, he’ll solve the mystery of Yelena.</p> 
      <p><b>Commander Ambrose</b> - 40, Powerful and focused, the Commander doesn’t suffer fools at all. Driven by his own code of behaviour, the Commander detests opulence and excess, viewing it as a waste of time and money. He believes in simplicity and logic, and has set up a strict way of living that is very straightforward and without compromise. Uncorrupted by power, he lives the life he endorses, makes sure all his people are treated fairly, and all their needs are met. Advisors and officers are promoted based solely on intelligence and skill. The Commander frowns on religious faith and is fearful of magic. To him, magicians are corrupt, seeking power and dominance over others. Anyone who develops magical powers in Ixia is promptly killed and any Sitian magicians caught within his territory are hung without trial. Commander Ambrose has kept Ixia closed off from Sitia, but recent events have made him more agreeable to a limited trade treaty. Although very stubborn, the Commander will change his mind when presented with a logical argument, and he will always learn all sides to a story before making a decision.</p> 
      <p><b>General Brazell</b> – 55, Brazell was a loyal supported of the Commander during the take-over and for a couple years after. However, Brazell is a man of action and the years of peace annoyed him. He wants the Commander to expand Ixia’s borders, and to import more Sitian goods. Not able to present a logical argument to the Commander about invading Sitia, Brazell has taken matters into his own hands. When an intelligent young man came to Brazell with an offer to help him increase his influence, Brazell welcomed him. The General can be patient and has many plans in the works to help him change the Commander’s mind about Sitia. His desire to exact revenge on his only son’s killer threatens to upset his grand scheme. Her death would make Brazell very happy, but the perfect opportunity hasn’t appeared. Brazell is willing to wait—he’s very good at waiting.</p> 
      <p><b>Adviser Mogkan</b> – 43, Mogkan is cunning and determined to gain power any way he can. He feels no regret on the actions he has taken to increase his magical abilities. And he is proud of what’s he has accomplished for the General. Although he is rather smug and can’t be trusted. It appears he is working for the General, but he’s just using him for his own long-term goals.</p>
