      <p>Following graduation from Cambridge, he lived in a low-income parish in <a href="5ebce71e27099376407b53fd32fd1cab.html" title="London">London</a> during <a href="0372882637344b5f94a2332ee6e02d0d.html" title="1858">1858</a> and <a href="b8f4163779cf148c545d2a9bd304c183.html" title="1859">1859</a> as preparation for his <a href="826f0aa291055190efb579e35c8d13ab.html" title="Ordination">ordination</a> to the Anglican <a href="04a03129d2cd6a0f4003f50c67bcc90b.html" title="Clergy">clergy</a>; there he discovered that <a href="801b8cb5e9a5c940a48c7bad635ebcc1.html" title="Baptism">baptism</a> made no apparent difference to the <a href="c0f2c1efa462b62057297420c50f7aed.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Morals">morals</a> and behaviour of his peers and began questioning his <a href="17eac4aded0af96579f21ccf5aed4a03.html" title="Faith">faith</a>. This experience would later serve as inspiration for his work <i>The Fair Haven</i>. Correspondence with his father about the issue failed to set his mind at peace, inciting instead his father's wrath. As a result, in September 1859 he emigrated to <a href="d464c1a199b65bbb10446010b7945b2a.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>, regarded as a British colony since the <a href="732fe081919c0b89fd448eca0282ba58.html" title="Treaty of Waitangi">Treaty of Waitangi</a> between the British Crown and many of the New Zealand Maori chiefs in 1840. Butler went there like many early British settlers of privileged origins, in order to put as much distance as possible between himself and his family. He wrote about his arrival and his life as a sheep farmer on Mesopotamia Station in <i>A First Year in Canterbury Settlement</i> (<a href="41ce021ac050a378f8034c00c44f6635.html" title="1863">1863</a>), and made a handsome profit when he sold his farm, but the chief achievement of his time in New Zealand was the drafts and source material for much of his masterpiece <i><a href="d60531399b4add566eaa12396b51ac5e.html" title="Erewhon">Erewhon</a></i>.</p> 
      <p>He returned to England in <a href="0bbd6bf07386bb8b87ff655422216ef0.html" title="1864">1864</a>, settling in rooms in <a href="b11cdf823e1470de4f77899ace712e28.html" title="Clifford's Inn">Clifford's Inn</a> (near <a href="0e788261238e2cfee8125eeb4500cc60.html" title="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</a>), where he lived for the rest of his life. In 1872, the utopian novel <i><a href="b0184045de29b125a9971bef50ca0adc.html" title="Erewhon">Erewhon</a></i> appeared anonymously, causing some speculation as to the identity of the author. When Butler revealed himself as the author, <i>Erewhon</i> made Butler a well-known figure, more because of this speculation than for its literary merits which are today undisputed.</p> 
      <p>His father's death in <a href="723c6eec4269696ab840bc2617934eef.html" title="1886">1886</a> resolved his financial problems for the last six years of his own life. He indulged himself, holidaying in <a href="a49ea5cb2fee55e0f82857eab31cfcd0.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> every summer and producing while he was there his works on the Italian landscape and art. His close interest in the art of the <a href="782ff1c42aad2ea55cf74ff2b8dfe6b4.html" title="Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy">Sacri Monti</a> is reflected in <i>Alps and Sanctuaries of Piedmont and the Canton Ticino</i> (1881) and <i>Ex Voto</i> (1888).</p> 
      <p>He wrote a number of other books, including a not so successful sequel, <i>Erewhon Revisited</i>. His <a href="d7b22b394362c30a811a2b16b002dfa7.html" title="Autobiographical novel">semi-autobiographical novel</a> <i><a href="841ea5395142f72a0f87c52319137597.html" title="The Way of All Flesh (novel)">The Way of All Flesh</a></i> did not appear in print until after his death, as he considered its tone of attack on Victorian hypocrisy too contentious.</p> 
      <p><i>Erewhon</i> revealed Butler's long interest in <a href="daac369a81d3bc431d3e1e105c4479ae.html" title="Charles Darwin">Darwin</a>'s theories of biological <a href="37e3f4b03d761fa9f241b65057deacb3.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a>, and in fact Darwin had, like him, visited New Zealand. In 1863, four years after Darwin published <i>On the Origin of Species,</i> the editor of a New Zealand newspaper, <a href="e1912a4f0256711c879f452fe623f3f2.html" title="The Press">The Press</a>, published a letter captioned <i><a href="bc2a583ba562b19261ad3a7a7bd8d210.html" title="Darwin Among the Machines">Darwin Among the Machines</a></i>. Signed <a href="4b9acb390ca57855922b075726daf099.html" title="Cellarius">Cellarius</a>, it was written by Butler; it compares human evolution to machine evolution, prophesizing (half in jest) that machines would eventually replace man in the supremacy of the earth: "In the course of ages we shall find ourselves the inferior race." <sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="2f06042a3f3bcdae58bce2b39e3613bb.html" title="">[1]</a></sup> The letter raises many of the themes now being debated by proponents of the <a href="6b77e79605a9e8e06585ca1f207a1e51.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Technological Singularity">Technological Singularity</a>, namely, that computers are evolving much faster than biological humans and that we are racing toward an unknowable future with explosive technological change.</p> 
      <p>Butler also spent a great deal of time criticising Darwin, and this criticism was motivated partly because Butler (himself a man living in the shadow of a previous Samuel Butler) believed that Darwin had not sufficiently acknowledged his grandfather <a href="e3d93f7984422e6beff5c81f93f13902.html" title="Erasmus Darwin">Erasmus Darwin</a>'s contribution to the origins of his theory.</p>

      <p>Butler developed a theory that the <i><a href="659a5d66b6651652a506430fa7aaf75f.html" title="Odyssey">Odyssey</a></i> came from the pen of a young <a href="25a5a050f7d0357e59c4a4500d8f7f29.html" title="Sicilian">Sicilian</a> woman, and that the scenes of the poem reflected the coast of <a href="0563cac8ed9a334367e6835a6ba5fc50.html" title="Sicily">Sicily</a> and its nearby islands. He described the evidence for this theory in his <i>The Authoress of the Odyssey</i> (1897) and in the introduction and footnotes to his prose translation of the <i>Odyssey</i> (1900). <a href="fa71ae700baded39910ff2803568855a.html" title="Robert Graves">Robert Graves</a> elaborated on this hypothesis in his novel <i>Homer's Daughter</i>. In a lecture titled "The Humour of Homer", delivered at The Working Man's College in London, 1892, Butler argued that Homer's gods in the Iliad are like men but "without the virtue" and that the poet "must have desired his listeners not to take them seriously." Butler translated the <i><a href="d420b71d819cbc8bfb2bf6fc76fdc2df.html" title="Iliad">Iliad</a></i> (1898). His other works include <i><a href="b7be85fee8eb4efbf3ada7e14219021b.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>'s Sonnets Reconsidered</i> (1899), a theory that Shakespeare's <a href="a930d2f867995aef808d2dcf71a37794.html" title="Sonnet">sonnets</a>, if rearranged, tell a story about a <a href="3e8e65ff0bb6ea64b4e992c8f6ffe460.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a> affair.</p>

      <p>In the 1920s <a href="43a84dd49f0b408b98443d921ee14ce9.html" title="Jonathan Cape">Jonathan Cape</a> published Butler's collected works in twenty volumes as <i>The Shrewsbury Edition of the Works of Samuel Butler</i>, but printed only 750 copies, making a complete set (if it can be found at all) unaffordable for the common reader. More easily available are the editions published by A.C. Fifield in 1908-1914. <i>Erewhon</i> and <i>The Way of All Flesh</i> remain in print as paperbacks.</p>

      <p>Butler's friend <a href="bbd15596f0f9ce31a753b5f0514eb627.html" title="Henry Festing Jones">Henry Festing Jones</a> wrote the authoritative biography: the two-volume <i>Samuel Butler, Author of Erewhon (1835-1902): A Memoir</i> (commonly known as Jones's <i>Memoir</i>), published in 1919 and now only available from antiquarian booksellers. Project Gutenberg <a href="418439fda181cfc5889084ff416e6de4.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gutenberg.net" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> hosts a shorter "Sketch" by Jones. More recently, Peter Raby has written a life: <i>Samuel Butler: A Biography</i> (Hogarth Press, 1991). <i>The Way of All Flesh</i> was published after Butler's death by his literary executor, R. Streatfeild, in 1903. This version however altered Butler's text in many ways and cut important material. The actual manuscript was edited by Daniel F. Howard as <i>Ernest Pontifex, or The Way of All Flesh</i> (Butler's original title) and published for the first time in 1965. It is currently in print again and, of course, should be the only version read. For a critical study, mostly about <i>The Way of All Flesh</i>, see Thomas L. Jeffers, <i>Samuel Butler Revalued</i> (University Park: Penn State Press, 1981).</p>
